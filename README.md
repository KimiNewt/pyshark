Python wrapper for tshark, allowing python packet parsing using wireshark dissectors.

Extended documentation: http://kiminewt.github.io/pyshark

**Python2 deprecation** - This package no longer supports Python2. If you wish to still use it in Python2, you can:
* Use version 0.3.8
* Install pyshark-legacy via pypi
* Clone the pyshark-legacy [repo](https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark-legacy), where bugfixes will be applied.

**Looking for contributors** - for various reasons I have a hard time finding time to maintain and enhance the package at the moment. Any pull-requests will be reviewed and if any one is interested and is suitable, I will be happy to include them in the project. Feel free to mail me at dorgreen1 at gmail.

There are quite a few python packet parsing modules, this one is different because it doesn't actually parse any packets, it simply uses tshark's (wireshark command-line utility) ability to export XMLs to use its parsing.

This package allows parsing from a capture file or a live capture, using all wireshark dissectors you have installed.
Tested on windows/linux.

## Installation

### All Platforms
Simply run the following to install the latest from pypi
```bash
pip install pyshark
```

Or install from the git repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KimiNewt/pyshark.git
cd pyshark/src
python setup.py install
```


### Mac OS X
You may have to install libxml which can be unexpected.  If you receive an error from clang or an error message about libxml, run the following:
```bash
xcode-select --install
pip install libxml
```
You will probably have to accept a EULA for XCode so be ready to click an "Accept" dialog in the GUI.



## Usage

### Reading from a capture file:

```python
>>> import pyshark
>>> cap = pyshark.FileCapture('/tmp/mycapture.cap')
>>> cap
<FileCapture /tmp/mycapture.cap (589 packets)>
>>> print cap[0]
Packet (Length: 698)
Layer ETH:
        Destination: BLANKED
        Source: BLANKED
        Type: IP (0x0800)
Layer IP:
        Version: 4
        Header Length: 20 bytes
        Differentiated Services Field: 0x00 (DSCP 0x00: Default; ECN: 0x00: Not-ECT (Not ECN-Capable Transport))
        Total Length: 684
        Identification: 0x254f (9551)
        Flags: 0x00
        Fragment offset: 0
        Time to live: 1
        Protocol: UDP (17)
        Header checksum: 0xe148 [correct]
        Source: BLANKED
        Destination: BLANKED
  ...
```

#### Other options

    interface='eth0',
    display_filter="tcp",
    use_redis=True,
    redis_host='redis.it.home.local',
    redis_key="develop"
)
>>> capture.sniff(timeout=50)

<LiveCapture (5 packets)>
>>> capture[3]
<UDP/HTTP Packet>

for packet in capture.sniff_continuously(packet_count=5):
    print(packet)
```


### Reading from a live interface using a ring buffer

### Accessing packet data:

Data can be accessed in multiple ways.
Packets are divided into layers, first you have to reach the appropriate layer and then you can select your field.

All of the following work:

```python
>>> packet['ip'].dst
192.168.0.1
>>> packet.ip.src
192.168.0.100
>>> packet[2].src
192.168.0.100
```

To test whether a layer is in a packet, you can use its name:

```python
>>> 'IP' in packet
True
```

To see all possible field names, use the `packet.layer.field_names` attribute (i.e. `packet.ip.field_names`) or the autocomplete function on your interpreter.

You can also get the original binary data of a field, or a pretty description of it:

```python
>>> p.ip.addr.showname
Source or Destination Address: 10.0.0.10 (10.0.0.10)
# And some new attributes as well:
>>> p.ip.addr.int_value
167772170
>>> p.ip.addr.binary_value
'\n\x00\x00\n'
```


### Decrypting packet captures

Pyshark supports automatic decryption of traces using the WEP, WPA-PWD, and WPA-PSK standards (WPA-PWD is the default).

```python
>>> cap1 = pyshark.FileCapture('/tmp/capture1.cap', decryption_key='password')
>>> cap2 = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='wi0', decryption_key='password', encryption_type='wpa-psk')
```

A tuple of supported encryption standards, SUPPORTED_ENCRYPTION_STANDARDS,
exists in each capture class.

```python
>>> pyshark.FileCapture.SUPPORTED_ENCRYPTION_STANDARDS
('wep', 'wpa-pwd', 'wpa-psk')
>>> pyshark.LiveCapture.SUPPORTED_ENCRYPTION_STANDARDS
('wep', 'wpa-pwd', 'wpa-psk')
```

### Reading from a file using a display filter

Pyshark display filters can be helpful in analyzing application focused traffic.
BPF filters do not offer as much flexibility as Wireshark's display filters.

```python
>>> cap1 = pyshark.FileCapture('/tmp/capture1.cap', display_filter="dns")
>>> cap2 = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='en0', display_filter="tcp.analysis.retransmission")
```
